# Gallery Wall Planner Tool

---

## Overview
The **Gallery Wall Planner Tool** is a software application designed to streamline the process of planning and installing art pieces in gallery spaces. It allows users to customize wall measurements, input art piece details, and visualize the layout of art pieces on a wall. The tool also calculates precise nail placement instructions for hanging art pieces, reducing the need for readjustments during installation.

This project was inspired by Yingxin's experience working at Roberta's Art Gallery, where inefficiencies in the installation process led to wasted time and effort. The goal is to create a visual tool that simplifies the planning process and improves workflow for gallery installations.

## Features
The Gallery Wall Planner Tool will include the following features:

1. **Custom Wall Measurements**:
   - Allow users to input wall dimensions (width, height).
   - Customize wall features such as doors, light switches, and fire alarms.

2. **Art Piece Input**:
   - Input art piece details, including:
     - Width and height.
     - Wire tautness.
     - Image or title.
     - Additional notes.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Drag-and-drop interface to place art pieces on the wall.
   - View measurements such as:
     - Distance from the floor.
     - Distance to the end of the wall.
     - Distance to adjacent art pieces.

4. **Nail Placement Calculation**:
   - Calculate and display instructions for where to place nails on the wall to hang art pieces accurately.

## Technology Choices
The team is open to exploring technologies that best suit the project's needs. Current considerations include:

- **Game Engine for 3D Traversability**:
  - A 3D environment could provide a more immersive experience.
  - However, the team may opt for a simpler 2D interface to keep the tool lightweight and easy to use.

- **Web App vs. Local Application**:
  - The decision has been made to develop a **desktop application** using **Python** for ease of use and accessibility.
